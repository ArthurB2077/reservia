For the lore, Reservia is a company of flights booking.

This project is a very simple website. Only style effects are used and more particulary SCSS \
The aim of this project is try to produce something pleasant to use while only using CSS

You only need a browser to check the website

This is also my first project so you should expect to see some things very far from perfect

Made with: SCSS - CSS preprocessor, Webstrom - Code editor
