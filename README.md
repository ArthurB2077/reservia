For the lore, Reservia is a booking company.

This project is a very basic website. Only CSS effects are used and a much of HTML. This is static and looks like more at a template than a real website

This is also my first project so you should expect to see some things very far from perfect

You only need a browser to check the website or check it out here: https://arthurb2077.github.io/reservia/
